## General Information
The objectives of this course is to provide the student with knowledge about designing high-performance and scalable algorithms for massive graph analytics. The course focuses on modeling and querying massive graph data in a distributed environment, designing algorithms, complexity analysis and optimization, for massive data graph problem analytics.
Upon successful completion of this course, the student is able to:
- model and query massive graph data in a distributed environment
- design and analyse efficient graph algorithms in real-world data-intensive applications;
- develop efficient applications using the best practices in a distributed environment (Spark, MapReduce, Neo4J, GraphX, etc.).


## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.8
- Anaconda - version 2020.11
